# D&D Character Sheet

A character sheet for D&amp;D 5e. See [here](https://neunzehnhundert97.github.io/DnD-Character-Sheet/Sheet_offline.html) for the sheet in action.

The sheet is intended to be used as local html file, so with the exception of JS and CSS libraries it is self-contained. After changing, the local file needs to be overwitten by the new version. Should you use a device, where saving from the browser is not an option, you can instead export the file's content als JSON string and import it at later uses.

The sheet comes in two versions. The online version loads external sources like bootstrap and jQuery, while the offline version does not and is also useable without an internet connection.
