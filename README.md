# DnD-Character-Sheet
A character sheet for D&amp;D 5e, see [here](https://neunzehnhundert97.github.io/DnD-Character-Sheet/Sheet_online.html) for the sheet in action.

The sheet is intended to be used as local html file, so with the exception of JS and CSS libraries it is self contained. After changing, the local file needs to be overwitten by the new version. Should you use a device, where saving from the browser is not an option, you can instead export the file's content als JSON string and import it at later uses.

Should you feel the need of playing without an active internet connection, please use the [offline version](https://neunzehnhundert97.github.io/DnD-Character-Sheet/Sheet_online.html), which has all external sources inlined.
